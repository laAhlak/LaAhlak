# Development Performance Optimization Guide

## üöÄ Optimizations Applied

### 1. **Turbopack Enabled**
- **Before**: Using webpack bundler (slow)
- **After**: Using Turbopack (up to 10x faster)
- **Usage**: `npm run dev` (now uses `--turbo` flag)
- **Fallback**: `npm run dev:webpack` (if Turbopack has issues)

### 2. **PWA Configuration Optimized**
- **Before**: PWA config loaded in development (heavy overhead)
- **After**: PWA only loads in production
- **Impact**: Eliminates 100+ lines of runtime caching config in dev

### 3. **Development-Specific Optimizations**
- **Source Maps**: Disabled in development for faster builds
- **Package Imports**: Optimized for Supabase and Stripe
- **Build Caching**: Better caching strategies

### 4. **Expected Performance Improvements**
- **Startup Time**: 39.5s ‚Üí ~5-10s (typical)
- **Hot Reload**: 38.7s ‚Üí ~1-3s
- **Module Count**: 474 modules should compile much faster

## üîß Additional Recommendations

### 1. **Keep .next folder persistent**
```bash
# Don't delete this folder during development
# It contains build cache
.next/
```

### 2. **Use the optimized dev command**
```bash
npm run dev  # Uses Turbopack (recommended)
```

### 3. **Monitor performance**
- Watch for "Ready in X.Xs" - should be under 15s
- Hot reloads should be under 5s
- If still slow, try `npm run dev:webpack` as fallback

### 4. **Environment Variables**
Make sure you have a `.env.local` file with:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
# ... other vars
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Turbopack has issues:
1. Use `npm run dev:webpack` (fallback to webpack)
2. Clear `.next` folder: `rm -rf .next`
3. Restart dev server

### If still slow:
1. Check if running in Docker (use host instead)
2. Ensure sufficient RAM (8GB+ recommended)
3. Close other heavy applications

## üìä Performance Monitoring

Watch these metrics:
- **Initial startup**: Should be under 15s
- **Hot reload**: Should be under 5s
- **Module count**: Should compile faster with Turbopack

The optimizations should reduce your development server startup from ~40s to ~5-10s, which is normal for a Next.js project of this size.
