## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **State Management:**
```typescript
const [step, setStep] = useState<'select' | 'amount'>('select')
const [beneficiaries, setBeneficiaries] = useState<Beneficiary[]>([])
const [selectedBeneficiary, setSelectedBeneficiary] = useState<Beneficiary | null>(null)
const [amount, setAmount] = useState('')
```

### **Data Flow:**
```
1. Modal opens → Fetch beneficiaries from database
2. User selects → Store selected beneficiary
3. User enters amount → Calculate fee and total
4. User submits → Create Stripe payment link
5. Redirect to Stripe → Complete payment
```

### **API Integration:**
```typescript
// Fetch beneficiaries
const { data } = await getBeneficiaries(user.id)

// Create payment
const response = await fetch('/api/stripe/create-payment-link', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount,
    recipient: selectedBeneficiary.name,
    note,
    userId
  })
})
```

---

## 📊 **Calculation Logic**

### **Fee Calculation:**
```typescript
const feeAmount = amount * 0.04  // 4% fee
const totalAmount = amount + feeAmount
```

### **Example:**
```
Amount to send: 100 JOD
Fee (4%):       4 JOD
Total:          104 JOD
```
